Just use python and type

python -m SimpleHTTPServer #in python3 type in `python3 -m http.server`
```

The whole website is organized in `index.html` and its css files are stored in `css/style.css`

### Where does the flashy animation come from?

It's D3js and stored inside the script tag in `index.html`

### Notes on some files

- `CNAME`: links `daviddao.github.io` to `daviddao.org`
- `keybase.txt`: used to confirm my [keybase](https://keybase.io/) identity
- `papers`: a folder where I store all my papers and a custom thumbnail for each of them

### Other stuff

I included a secret doge meme `console.log()` in `index.html` just for fun!
